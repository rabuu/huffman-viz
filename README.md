This repository contains a Rust library crate ([huffman](huffman))
that provides a basic implementation of the Huffman coding algorithm.
<br>
Additionally there is a [web app](webapp) visualizing exactly this algorithm,
written in Rust/WASM using [yew](https://yew.rs) and [trunk](https://trunkrs.dev).
