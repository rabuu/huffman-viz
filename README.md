# huffman-viz

## lib
This repository contains a Rust library crate ([huffman](huffman))
that provides a basic implementation of the Huffman coding algorithm.

## webapp
Additionally there is a [web app](webapp) visualizing the algorithm,
written in Rust/WASM using [yew](https://yew.rs) and [trunk](https://trunkrs.dev).

You can see it [here](https://rbuurman.de/projekte/huffman).
